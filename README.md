# My Personal Project
- [Markdown Cheetsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

im going to make a website with the ability to register, login, post, and view the posts of other users.

the user will also be able to view other user's profile, register their own account, and track how many likes/dislikes they recieve on a post.
